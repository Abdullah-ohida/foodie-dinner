            <li>
                <h1>Nut Butter, Banana, and Chia Seed Toast</h1>
                <p>Try this superfood twist on classic PB and toast with 1/2 a banana (sliced) and a sprinkle of chia,
                    which is packed with vitamins and minerals (like six times more calcium than milk!).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h1>Berry and Yogurt Smoothie</h1>
                <p>Here’s a simple and delicious smoothie for the morning rush. Blend frozen fruit (banana and berries
                    work well) with Greek yogurt and a liquid of your choice (milk, juice, coconut water—whatever you
                    like). Freeze overnight and thaw throughout
                    the day to enjoy in the afternoon or blend up in the morning.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h1>Savory Oatmeal With an Egg</h1>
                <p>Take oatmeal to a whole new level by making it savory. Prepare as usual with milk or water, but add a
                    pinch of salt and pepper instead of any cinnamon or sugar. Then top with an over-easy or poached egg
                    and sprinkle on a little cheese
                    for an extra tasty kick.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h1>Quinoa Fruit Salad</h1>
                <p>Spice up a plain old fruit cup with a scoop of quinoa. Toss the whole shebang around until the quinoa
                    is evenly distributed. Add a dressing of honey, lime, and basil for a little extra body.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h1>Tomato Toast With Macadamia Ricotta</h1>
                <p>Here’s a healthier take on a classic breakfast sandwich: Take 2 slices of a hearty whole-grain bread,
                    spread each slice with 1 tablespoon of homemade macadamia ricotta cheese, and sprinkle with shiso or
                    basil, kosher salt, and fresh cracked
                    pepper to taste. Add 1-2 hearty slices of fresh heirloom tomatoes (blotted with paper towel to
                    remove excess liquid) and enjoy.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h1>Quinoa and Chia Porridge</h1>
                <p>Cooking quinoa in milk (cow, soy, or almond) and adding some sweet spices and fruit makes for a great
                    substitute for classic hot breakfast cereals. Plus, it’s high in protein and essential amino acids
                    like lysine, which is essential for
                    tissue growth and repair. Simply put all the ingredients into a pot and bring to a boil. Then
                    simmer, stir, top with your favorite add-ons, and enjoy!</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h1>Avocado Toast With Egg</h1>
                <p>Sometimes simple is just better. Top two lightly toasted slices of whole-grain bread with smashed
                    avocado and a sprinkling of salt and pepper. Layer on two sunny-side up eggs for a healthy dose of
                    protein, and you've got a well-rounded
                    breakfast. Stack 'em in a tupperware container for easy transport or cook the yolks a bit more and
                    make the whole thing into a sandwich.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h1>Chocolate Quinoa Breakfast Bowl</h1>
                <p>Here’s a healthy way to have chocolate for breakfast. A bowlful of quinoa makes for a filling,
                    protein-rich base, and the banana and berries add a few servings of fruit.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h1>Overnight Crock-Pot Egg Casserole</h1>
                <p>Wake up to a house smelling like sausage and effortlessly put breakfast on your plate, all thanks to
                    the beauty of a slow cooker. Layer the vegetables, sausage, and cheese in the Crock-Pot, then top
                    with a mix of eggs and cream (you'd
                    be fine using regular or nondairy milk too for a lighter option), and you're just one sleep away
                    from a delicious meal.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h1>Zucchini Bread Oatmeal</h1>
                <p>Turn a classic baked loaf into oatmeal with this recipe. Adding shredded zucchini is a great way to
                    fit in an extra serving of veggies. Throw on a handful of toasted walnuts for some added crunch.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h1>Egg Breakfast Muffins</h1>
                <p>Finally, a muffin without allllll the sugar. These guys are simple to make ahead of time, and last
                    all week. Blend or whisk eggs with spinach, bacon, and cheese, then pour the mixture into muffin
                    tins. Bake for 15-20 minutes before serving
                    or storing in the refrigerator for later.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h1>Open-Face Breakfast Sandwich</h1>
                <p>Who doesn’t love an egg sandwich? Simply toss arugula with olive oil and lemon juice before frying
                    eggs with a dash of salt and pepper. Place on top of whole-wheat toast layered with ricotta and a
                    sprinkle of Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.
                    Wrap in foil and enjoy whenever the craving hits!</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h1>Peanut Butter and Banana Smoothie</h1>
                <p>Smoothies are a perfect on-the-go snack any time of day. Blend frozen bananas, peanut butter, soy
                    milk, Greek yogurt, honey, and a few ice cubes. If this is a morning snack, keep it in a
                    tight-sealing container and throw it in a gym or
                    work bag. For an afternoon boost, prep it the night before and freeze. Remove in the morning, and it
                    will be thawed and ready to enjoy after lunch. Tip: Add a scoop of your favorite chocolate or
                    vanilla protein for an extra protein
                    boost.

            <li>
                <h1>PB and J Waffle Sandwich</h1>
                <p>Try this sweet take on a classic breakfast sandwich the next time you're eating on the go. Prepare a
                    whole-grain toaster waffle and slice in half. Spread with 2 tablespoons nut butter and jelly of your
                    choice, and layer sliced strawberries
                    on top.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h1>Sweet Potato and Black Bean Breakfast Burrito</h1>
                <p>Breakfast burritos are a great, easy snack to keep on hand. Make a bunch, wrap in foil, and keep in
                    the freezer for whenever the craving hits. Protein from the eggs and black beans keeps you fuller
                    longer, and the sweet potato keeps things
                    interesting.
                </p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <h1>Chocolate Peanut Butter Granola Apple Bites</h1>
                <p>This is a perfect pick for apple season. Cut your favorite kind of apple into wedges and scoop nut
                    butter onto each slice. Sprinkle with oats or granola and cinnamon, and drizzle a bit of melted
                    chocolate on top. Wrap up the apple slices
                    in foil or plastic wrap to save for later or enjoy as is.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h1>Chocolate Pumpkin Oatmeal</h1>
                <p>A heaping dollop of pumpkin puree is a great way to squeeze in an extra dose of veggies. Plus, the
                    super-orange superfood is packed with nutrients and a healthy dose of fiber. This recipe pairs the
                    pumpkin with oats, chia seeds, cocoa,
                    and almond milk for a quick and easy breakfast.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h1>Blueberry Almond Overnight Oats</h1>
                <p>This is the ultimate busy-bee breakfast. Combine oats, chia seeds, blueberries, vanilla, almond milk,
                    and maple syrup in a sealed container the night before. In the morning, top with slivered almonds
                    and half a sliced banana, and you're
                    ready for breakfast. If you're in the mood for something warm, heat in the microwave for 1-2
                    minutes.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h1>conut Yogurt Quinoa Muffins</h1>
                <p>By this point, it's probably obvious we think quinoa makes anything better. So when it comes to
                    muffins? It’s a no-brainer. Try these little bites for breakfast or an after-lunch treat.
